                "If you hadn't guessed, the girl in the cap and gown is me. I graduate from Brigham Young University, Idaho in July 2020 and I'm pretty excited about it. With all the stress of school, kids, and quarantining, I had to find something to do to keep myself sane. 
                I also wanted something I could do with my software developer husband, so here we are!

                "I find building the front end of websites pretty exciting. All the parts that you see on a website are part of the front end of web development. I was never really into art. However, I feel like we each find our "thing," our creative outlet.
                I enjoy designing websites for the sole purpose of helping others. The websites I build are simple and to the point, but a website vital to one's busniess nowadays.

                "The difference between those other website building companies and I 
                is that it's a one on one experience. I don't build templates for you to choose from, rather,
                I take your vision and make it a reality. We work together side by side. I want you 
                to be there every step of the way. So let me know if I 
                can help you build your dream site."
